# guice - Trying to extract go's juice to make it more fun

Trying to make some fun out of go and explore the language features while at it. 

* (fake) Functors - they are naturally polymorphic, but maybe we can have a subset of the types and form a category based on it
* fix point - see how much we can explore recursion in unnamed entities here
* (fake) monads - same as the functors, requires parametric polymorpshim to act on the Set category for all types, but we try to restrict a subset of it
